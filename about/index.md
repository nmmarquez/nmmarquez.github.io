A blog where a non-profit worker/student cant get out all his ramblings in one digital format. I am currently a 
student of public health at the University of Washington pursuing a MPH. I also work with the Institute of Health 
Metrics and Evaluation as well as the Peers and Wellness study team at the University of California San Francisco. 
Born and raised in Santa Ana, CA I am a data hacker at heart with an affinity towards measuring demographic 
transitions and how informed public policy can best benefit the people who live in a particular urban area. A winded 
way of saying I haven't chosen a "career" yet.
