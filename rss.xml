      <title>NB1 and NB2 Dispersion</title>
      <link>http://nmmarquez.github.io//nb1-nb2-uncertainty</link>
      <description>The other day I started working with a colleague on propagating uncertainty for
a negative binomial generalized linear model. To my surprise I found that there
was a couple of different ways to define the probability distribution that led
to more than a bit of confusion on my end, but got me messing around with how
you could simulate over-dispersed count data in a couple of ways. It also got me
working with TMB again and the woes of dealing with nonlinear optimization.

      <title>Simulating Spatially Correlated Data</title>
      <link>http://nmmarquez.github.io//simulating-spatial-data</link>
      <description>A couple of weeks ago I ran into a problem where I needed to create some spatially correlated data for a project and I
realized that I didn't know the first thing about how to go about doing it. I was lucky to find that the
[paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01180) that I was trying to replicate did a great job of detailing their methods in
such a way that I was able to create some spatial data of my own. The idea is that you need to create a covariance
matrix of the relationships of your data to pull form a multivariate random normal distribution.

      <description>Setting up a blog so I have a place to post my ideas and work that I manage to do outside of work and school (ha!).
Hoping this is the beginning of something long and beautiful so here goes nothing.
