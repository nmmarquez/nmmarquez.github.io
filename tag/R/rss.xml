	     <p>A couple of weeks ago I ran into a problem where I needed to create some spatially correlated data for a project and I 
realized that I didn’t know the first thing about how to go about doing it. I was lucky to find that the 
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01180">paper</a> that I was trying to replicate did a great job of detailing their methods in 
such a way that I was able to create some spatial data of my own. The idea is that you need to create a covariance 
matrix of the relationships of your data to pull form a multivariate random normal distribution.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)
</script>

<p><script type="math/tex">\mu</script> is just the scalar mean and can be set to any real number but defining a sensible covariance matrix was 
originally difficult. The way that Riebler et al. did it was by using a matrix Q </p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[

Q_{i,j}= 
\begin{cases}
    n_{\delta_{i}},& \text{if  } i = j \\
    -1,              & \text{if  } i \sim j \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
    
\end{cases}
 %]]></script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\delta_{i}</script> is the number of neighbors a location has and <script type="math/tex">i \sim j</script> means that the two locations are 
adjacent. Im used to working with spatial polygons data frames in R and found that its pretty easy to create this 
matrix with the right packages. Here’s an example with US state shape file.</p>

<pre><code>library(sp)
library(surveillance)
library(spdep)
library(MASS)

# load in some USA data to work with
load(url("http://biogeo.ucdavis.edu/data/gadm2/R/USA_adm2.RData"))
cont_usa_locs &lt;- c("Texas", "Louisiana")

# spatial polygons data frame to simulate from
cont_usa &lt;- gadm[(gadm@data$NAME_1 %in% cont_usa_locs),]
cont_usa$ID &lt;- 1:length(cont_usa)

# adjacency matrix for spatial data 1's if adjacent 0 otherwise
adjmat &lt;- poly2adjmat(cont_usa)

# Create Q from an adjacency matrix
n_delta_i &lt;- rowSums(adjmat)
Q &lt;- adjmat * -1
diag(Q) &lt;- n_delta_i
</code></pre>

<p>Using the inverse of Q as the covariance matrix creates a smooth spatial dispersion, that you can see below, when 
compared to just simple dispersion at random. A more complete example can be found 
<a href="https://github.com/nmmarquez/spatial_epi/blob/master/project/project_outlay.r">here</a>.</p>
