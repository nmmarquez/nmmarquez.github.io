        <title>Rejection Sampling</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Rejection sampling allows us to sample from some target distribution when we have a proposal distribution. The algorithm works by first drawing a random value, say \(u\), that is between zero and one from uniform (\(U(0,1)\)) distribution. Next a random value for \(x\) is drawn from the proposal distribution \(f(x)\). Finally there is an acceptance/rejection step that asks: if the probability \(u\) is less than the density of \(g(x)\) at \(x\) divided by the density of \(f(x)*p_A\) then we&amp;#39;ll accept \(x\) as having been drawn from \(g(x)\). If not well sample another value for \(x\) from \(f(x)\) and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>NB1 and NB2 Dispersion</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I started working with a colleague on propagating uncertainty for
a negative binomial generalized linear model. To my surprise I found that there
was a couple of different ways to define the probability distribution that led
to more than a bit of confusion on my end, but got me messing around with how
you could simulate over-dispersed count data in a couple of ways. It also got me
working with TMB again and the woes of dealing with nonlinear optimization.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Simulating Spatially Correlated Data</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I ran into a problem where I needed to create some spatially correlated data for a project and I
realized that I didn&amp;#39;t know the first thing about how to go about doing it. I was lucky to find that the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01180&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that I was trying to replicate did a great job of detailing their methods in
such a way that I was able to create some spatial data of my own. The idea is that you need to create a covariance
matrix of the relationships of your data to pull form a multivariate random normal distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Latex with Jekyll</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I am trying out a new layout that will hopefully let me do inline latex like so \(\beta\) as well as its own thing like  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello Worlds</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Setting up a blog so I have a place to post my ideas and work that I manage to do outside of work and school (ha!).
Hoping this is the beginning of something long and beautiful so here goes nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
